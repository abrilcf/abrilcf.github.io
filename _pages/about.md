Hello everyone,

I'm currently a PhD student at Durham University (UK) under the supervision of [Chris G. Willcocks](https://cwkx.github.io/) and [Hubert P. H. Shum](http://hubertshum.com/). For the past two and a half years I've been working on deep generative modeling for medical imaging. Specifically, my research aims to leverage 2D images for generating 3D representations for potential applications like Computed Tomography from biplanar X-rays.
