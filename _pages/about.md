I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/) advised by Dr. [Chris G. Willcocks](https://cwkx.github.io/) and Dr. [Hubert P. H. Shum](http://hubertshum.com/).

My research works on deep generative modeling for medical imaging. Specifically, I've been working on the deveopment of state-of-the-art deep learning models that leverage 2D images for generating 3D representations for potential applications like Computed Tomography from X-rays.

I have a B.Sc. in Computer Systems Engineering from the Higher School of Computing of [The National Polytechnic Institute](https://www.ipn.mx/english/), where I was advised by Prof. [Marco A. Barranco-Jimenez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fcLNJWQAAAAJ&hl=en). My undergraduate thesis *Prototype for Embryonic Heart Rate Monitoring* received the Best Thesis Award among other 73 thesis.

Before joining Durham University, I visited [Eastern New Mexico University](https://www.enmu.edu/) as part of a study abroad schorlarship, advised by Dr. [Hamid Allamehzadeh](https://www.enmu.edu/academics/colleges-departments/college-liberal-arts-sciences/department-of-mathematical-sciences/faculty-staff-mathematics) to pursue coursework in Electronics Engineering Technology, and collaborated in a research project to control a solar-powered golf cart via voice recognition. I also took elective courses from the M.S. Computer Science program at the [Computing Research Center - IPN](https://www.cic.ipn.mx/).

Outside research, you can find me hitting the gym, listening to podcasts or audiobooks. I also love comedy and tacos.
