Hello everyone,

I'm currently a PhD student at Durham University (UK) under the supervision of Chris G. Willcocks and Hubert P. H. Shum. For the past two and a half years I've been working on deep generative modeling for medical imaging. Specifically, my research tries to leverage 2D images for generating 3D representations for (future) potential applications like Computed Tomography from biplanar X-rays.
