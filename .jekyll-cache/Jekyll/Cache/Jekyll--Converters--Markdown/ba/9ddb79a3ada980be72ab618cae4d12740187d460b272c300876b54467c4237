I"í<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at Durham University (UK) under the supervision of <a href="https://cwkx.github.io/">Chris G. Willcocks</a> and <a href="http://hubertshum.com/">Hubert P. H. Shum</a>. For the past two and a half years Iâ€™ve been working on deep generative modeling for medical imaging. Specifically, my research aims to leverage 2D images for generating 3D representations for potential applications like Computed Tomography from biplanar X-rays.</p>
